                <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
                any other concerns, please contact an Organizer. Organizer/Volunteer
                name will be highlighted with the Organizer tag in Hopin Platform or drop an
                email to <a href="mailto:report@in.pycon.org">report@in.pycon.org</a></p>
                <p><strong>All reports will be kept confidential.</strong> In some cases we may determine that a
                public statement will need to be made. If that’s the case, the identities of
                all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals
                instruct us otherwise.</p>
                <p><strong>If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law
                enforcement first.</strong> If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is
                appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify
                them.</p>
                <p>**If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space
                where it happened is covered by the <a href="coc.html">Code of
                Conduct</a>, we encourage you to still report it.
                We would much rather have a few extra reports where we decide to take no
                action, rather than miss a report of an actual violation. We do not look
                negatively on you if we find the incident is not a violation. And knowing about
                incidents that are not violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help
                us to improve the Code of Conduct or the processes surrounding it.</p>
                <h3 id="in-your-report-please-include">In Your Report Please Include</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)</li>
                <li>Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there
                were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.</li>
                <li>When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.</li>
                <li>Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g.
                a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a link.</li>
                <li>Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.</li>
                <li>If you believe this incident is ongoing.</li>
                <li>Any other information you believe we should have.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="what-happens-after-you-file-a-report-">What Happens After you File a Report?</h3>
                <p>The Diversity and Inclusion Working Group will immediately meet to review the
                incident and determine:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>What happened.</li>
                <li>Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.</li>
                <li>Who the bad actor was.</li>
                <li>Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone’s
                physical safety.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety,
                the volunteer’s immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This
                means we may delay an “official” response until we believe that the situation
                has ended and that everyone is physically safe.</p>
                <p>Once the working group has a complete account of the events they will make a
                decision as to how to respond. Responses may include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).</li>
                <li>A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s) involved.</li>
                <li>A public reprimand.</li>
                <li>Expulsion from the conference with no refund.</li>
                <li>A permanent or temporary ban from some or all PyCon India spaces (mailing lists, IRC, etc.)</li>
                <li>A request for a public or private apology.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We’ll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a
                resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.</p>
                <p>Once we’ve determined our final action, we’ll contact the original reporter to
                let them know what action (if any) we’ll be taking. We’ll take into account
                feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we don’t
                guarantee we’ll act on it.</p>
                <p>Conference volunteers will be happy to help participants contact venue security
                or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
                experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We
                value your attendance.</p>
                <p>Finally, the Diversity Chair will make a report on the situation to the
                Conference Chair.</p>
                <h3 id="what-if-your-report-concerns-a-possible-violation-by-a-volunteer-">What if Your Report Concerns a Possible Violation by a Volunteer?</h3>
                <p>In that case, you can make a report directly to the chair of the Diversity
                workgroup, Sukanya Mandal. She can be reached at her email address
                <a href="mailto:sukanyamandal06@gmail.com">sukanyamandal06@gmail.com</a> and the email address <a href="mailto:report@in.pycon.org">report@in.pycon.org</a> The chair
                will follow the usual enforcement process with the other members, but will
                exclude the member(s) that the report concerns, from any discussion or decision
                making.</p>
                <p>If your report concerns the chair of the Diversity workgroup, please send your
                report directly to the PSF Board of Directors at <a href="mailto:psf@python.org">psf@python.org</a> instead.</p>
                <p>Thank you for helping to make PyCon India a welcoming, friendly event for all.
